Once that's complete, the children design a Lego robot. We then set to work programming the robot using a \"code block\" version of Python to move it around a Lego obstacle course. It is far from simple and we are often up against teams of far older children...but we get there with some trial and error.

In 2024 that was how best to use technology to solve problems encountered by people that explore the ocean!\n\nWe talked about how scientists conduct research, then the children researched the theme identified a problem and brain stormed solutions. We then talked about how we communicate our ideas. We talked to an expert (a friendly oceanographer), and the children prepared a presentation. They took their slide deck to the competition at Canterbury Christchurch University, and presented their solution to a judges panel of academics and engineers, answering some tough questions too! Quite a daunting task when you're 9!!\n\n[Find out more about the First Lego League here!](https://www.firstlegoleague.org/)\n\n## Go karts\n\nAfter the Lego League finishes we pack away and change gear (metaphorically, our go karts only have one speed - fast!)\n\nThe children compete in the Young Eco Engineers go kart race. This starts with building the Go Kart from a kit. The children learn to drill, cut and screw, to measure and use a wide range of tools. We then choose a theme and decorate the kart. They spend hours on the playground honing their driving skills as well as time indoors writing in their engineering workbooks. The engineering workbooks ask about key engineering principles, the environment, team work, and kart design. Finally, race day, the adults drive to Gillingham, where we race against 11 other teams around a circuit. There is always drama on the track, but our mini-racers stay cool and collected and often bring home a trophy!\n\n![](files/gokarts.jpg){fig-alt=\"A photo of the go kart track with go karts racing\"}\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"35%\"}\n![](files/Robot.jpg){fig-alt=\"A robot our science club designed\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"5%\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\nWhen I am not putting my coding skills to use trying to solve complex epidemiological issues, I lead a science club at a local Primary School where I teach 9-11 year olds to use Python and build and drive go karts!\n\n## Lego League: Teaching coding and science skills\n\nOur team compete in the Kent First Lego League Tournament each year.
