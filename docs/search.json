    "text": "Why focus on people with severe or complex mental illness?\nPeople with severe mental illness are at increased risk of heart disease. Once diagnosed they are also less likely to receive the best treatment, more likely to have multiple hospital stays and more likely to die due to their heart disease.\nDespite this, we don’t know very much about how well heart failure is diagnosed in people with severe or complex mental illness. We know for cancer, people with severe mental illness are less likely to attend screening and more likely to be diagnosed at a late stage. We want to find out if the same is true for heart failure, because like cancer, early diagnosis of heart failure is key in improving heart failure outcomes.\n\nWhat might the data tell us?\nWe think the numbers of patients with severe mental illness will likely be small, but the ability to link rich cohort data with electronic health records will be really valuable. It should enable us to take a closer look at who does and doesn’t attend cancer screening and physical health checks - hopefully informing targeted approaches to improve screening in people with mental health conditions.\nRead more about the planned research on the BHF data science centre website!."

This starts with building the Go Kart from a kit. The children learn to drill, cut and screw, to measure and use a wide range of tools. We then choose a theme and decorate the kart. They spend hours on the playground honing their driving skills as well as time indoors writing in their engineering workbooks. The engineering workbooks ask about key engineering principles, the environment, team work, and kart design. Finally, race day, the adults drive to Gillingham, where we race against 11 other teams around a circuit. There is always drama on the track, but our mini-racers stay cool and collected and often bring home a trophy!"

These include things like offering stop smoking services to all smokers and making sure that people with heart conditions are getting the right treatment. For people with severe mental illness (SMI), GPs receive payments if all people with SMI have a health check.\nBut, some people might not want that health check, and others might not be suitable for the health check. To make it fair across all GP practices. doctors can remove these people from their tally."

Equally, if someone is making an informed decision not to have a health check, that’s also fine. But, just because a patient doesn’t attend their appointment doesn’t mean they don’t need or want their physical health checked. There are lots of potential reasons why someone might not respond to an invitation, or might miss an appointment."

    "text": "What do our findings mean?\nThe proportion of patients removed for “informed dissent” appears to be increasing. However, whether this truly represents informed dissent is hard to work out. Some people with severe mental illness may be missing invitations due to their poor mental health. If they are recorded as “informed dissent” they may not be contacted again for physical health screening in that year. While a GP still has duty of care for people who are removed from the totals, more needs to be done to ensure those people who may struggle to respond to invitations to screening, to book appointments, or to attend the GP practice have access to these important screening programmes every year."

You can read more about them on the National Academy for Social Prescribing website.\nOur research found that there have been 5.5 million referrals to social prescribing since the scheme began, and that referrals for people in the most deprived areas have been increasing year on year. In 2023, 1.3 million people were referred to social prescribing, while 12% refused the service. Refusals for the service appear to be reducing, while the number of referrals for people in the most deprived areas are increasing.\nIt looks like social prescribing is well received, though further research is required to assess whether it is reaching the groups who need it most, and whether it is making long-term differences to the quality of life for people with long-term health conditions. In particular, we are interested to see how well it is used for people with severe mental illness.\nRead the full paper here."
